# vllm-model-sim

An out-of-tree vLLM plugin that runs the **full vLLM serving stack** on CPU
(incl. macOS) without a real model, real weights, or a GPU. It returns random
tokens and sleeps to reproduce a target model's latency profile, so you can
benchmark and load-test vLLM's scheduler, batching, API server, and streaming
on a laptop. For prefill/decode disaggregation, the NIXL KV-transfer connector
is replaced with a bandwidth-based latency model — no real RDMA transfers occur.

See [Supported Models](#supported-models) for the complete list.

## Supported Models

| Model | Hardware | Deployment Modes | Directory |
|-------|----------|------------------|-----------|
| Qwen3-32B | H100 SXM5 | Standalone | [models/qwen3-32b/deployments/h100-sxm5/standalone](models/qwen3-32b/deployments/h100-sxm5/standalone/) |

## Latency models

Latency configuration lives in the model's `config.json` under the `latency`
key. The `type` field selects which model to use; it defaults to `"linear"`.

Any `latency` block can be overridden at launch with `--hf-overrides`.

> [!WARNING]
> The `--hf-overrides` flag **replaces** the entire `latency` mapping, so include
> every key you want set:
> 
> ```bash
> VLLM_SIMULATED_PLUGIN_CONFIG=/path/to/sim-config.json \
> vllm serve <model-id> --load-format dummy \
>   --hf-overrides '{"latency": {"type": "linear", "base_ms": 5.0, ...}}'
> ```

Both models support `deterministic_length` (bool, default `true`): when set,
the EOS token is masked so requests always run to `max_tokens` — convenient for
fixed-length ITL benchmarking.

### Linear model (`type: "linear"`)

A simple affine formula — one coefficient per batch dimension:

```
step_time_ms = base_ms
             + prefill_ms_per_token * num_prefill_tokens
             + decode_ms_per_seq    * num_decode_seqs
             + ctx_ms_per_ktoken    * (sum_context_len / 1000)
```

Use this when you have empirical timing data and want to fit coefficients
directly, or when you want a fast, interpretable model with no hardware spec.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `base_ms` | float | `0.0` | Fixed overhead per step (ms). |
| `prefill_ms_per_token` | float | `0.0` | Marginal cost per prefill token (ms). |
| `decode_ms_per_seq` | float | `0.0` | Marginal cost per decode sequence (ms). |
| `ctx_ms_per_ktoken` | float | `0.0` | Marginal cost per 1 k tokens of total context (ms). |

All coefficients must be ≥ 0.

```json
"latency": {
  "base_ms": 5.0,
  "prefill_ms_per_token": 0.05,
  "decode_ms_per_seq": 1.2,
  "ctx_ms_per_ktoken": 0.3,
  "deterministic_length": true
}
```

### Physics model (`type: "physics"`)

A hardware-aware roofline model adapted from
[BLIS](https://github.com/inference-sim/inference-sim). It derives step time from first
principles — FLOPs, HBM bandwidth, and model architecture — rather than fitted
coefficients:

```
T_prefill = beta_pf * max(T_compute_pf, T_kv_write_pf)
T_decode  = beta_dc * max(T_compute_dc, T_weight_load + T_kv_read_dc)
step_time_ms = T_prefill + T_decode + beta_base
```

Compute and memory terms are derived from the architecture fields already
present in `config.json` (layer count, hidden size, attention heads, FFN
dimensions, MoE topology). Both dense and MoE architectures are supported,
including interleaved MoE layers and shared-expert FFNs.

Use this when you have hardware specs (peak TFLOPs, HBM bandwidth) and want
predictions that automatically reflect model architecture and tensor-parallel
degree without manual coefficient fitting. Tensor parallelism is genuinely
simulated: launching the sim with `--tensor-parallel-size N` spawns N real vLLM
worker processes, and the model divides per-GPU compute, KV, and weight-load
work by `N` so each worker's per-step sleep reflects the TP speedup. The degree
is read from `--tensor-parallel-size`, not set in `config.json`.

**`hardware` block (required):**

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `peak_tflops` | float | required | Peak BF16/FP16 Tensor Core throughput of **one GPU**, without sparsity (TFLOPs). See reference table below. |
| `hbm_gbps` | float | required | HBM memory bandwidth of **one GPU** (GB/s). See reference table below. |
| `weight_dtype` | string | `"bfloat16"` | Byte-width used for weight loads. Use `bfloat16` or `float16` for standard serving; `float8`/`int8` for quantized models. |

**GPU reference values** — use dense (non-sparsity) figures, which match real
LLM inference:

| GPU | `peak_tflops` | `hbm_gbps` |
|-----|--------------|------------|
| H100 SXM5 | `989` | `3350` |
| H100 PCIe | `756` | `2000` |
| A100 SXM4 80 GB | `312` | `2000` |
| A100 PCIe 80 GB | `312` | `1935` |
| L40S | `362` | `864` |
| A10G | `31` | `600` |

**Top-level keys:**

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `beta` | [float, float, float] | `[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]` | Scaling factors `[beta_pf, beta_dc, beta_base]` (all ≥ 0). |

> [!NOTE]
> The tensor-parallel degree is **not** a `config.json` key — it is read from
> vLLM's `--tensor-parallel-size` at load time (any `tp` written into the
> `latency` block is ignored). The model divides FLOPs, KV, and weight-load
> terms by that degree to model per-GPU work. Collective-communication overhead
> (~2 all-reduces per dense layer) is not modeled and is absorbed by `beta`.

`beta` absorbs software overhead that the roofline does not model (kernel launch
latency, NCCL collectives, framework overhead). Start with `[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]`
and tune against a short real benchmark run:

- **`beta_pf`** scales total prefill time. Raise it if measured TTFT exceeds
  prediction (typical range 1.0–1.3 for memory-bound prefill).
- **`beta_dc`** scales total decode time. Raise it if measured ITL exceeds
  prediction (typical range 1.0–1.5 for decode-bound workloads).
- **`beta_base`** is a fixed additive term (ms). Use it to capture constant
  per-step overhead such as scheduling or sampler time (typically 0–5 ms).

**Example — Qwen3-235B-A22B on A100 SXM4 80 GB (TP=8):**

Set the tensor-parallel degree on the serve command
(`vllm serve … --tensor-parallel-size 8`); it is not part of the `latency` block:

```json
"latency": {
  "type": "physics",
  "hardware": {
    "peak_tflops": 312.0,
    "hbm_gbps": 2000.0,
    "weight_dtype": "bfloat16"
  },
  "beta": [1.0, 1.0, 0.0],
  "deterministic_length": true
}
```

## Evaluation

The `evaluation/` directory provides an automated tool to measure how accurately the simulator reproduces the latency and throughput behavior of a real vLLM server running on an H100 GPU. The tool runs identical benchmark workloads against both a real model deployment and the simulated model, then reports per-metric error (MAPE) and signed error to guide physics model tuning.

See [evaluation/README.md](evaluation/README.md) for the full operator runbook, including deployment steps, how to run the evaluation, and how to interpret and act on the results.

### The real question: how much fidelity do you need?

All three tools remove the GPU. They differ in how much *real vLLM behavior* they preserve, and that fidelity is not free — it is the axis to decide on.

- **vllm-model-sim** runs the actual vLLM scheduler, batching, streaming, and API server; only the model forward pass is replaced with a sleep. So the emergent behavior you observe — batch composition, preemption, queueing, prefix caching, chunked prefill — is vLLM's real behavior, not a model of it. Use it when the *thing under test is vLLM itself* (or something whose correctness depends on vLLM's exact behavior).
- **BLIS** reimplements the cluster (KV cache, preemption, autoscaling) as a discrete-event model. It is faster and can explore hardware you don't own, but it cannot reproduce a vLLM-specific behavior or regression, because no vLLM code runs.
- **llm-d-inference-sim** reproduces vLLM's API surface and metrics but no scheduling logic. It is ideal as a cheap pod stand-in.

It all comes down to *which metrics have to be simulated accurately* for the experiment to be meaningful. If the metrics you care about only need realistic latency and load behavior, a lower-fidelity stand-in like llm-d-inference-sim, or a capacity model like BLIS, is usually the better fit. Reach for vllm-model-sim when those metrics depend on vLLM's real scheduling and batching, not just on plausible-looking latency.

### Maintenance

Because this is an out-of-tree vLLM plugin rather than a reimplementation, it inherits vLLM's behavior for free and stays correct as vLLM evolves. When vLLM changes its scheduler, batching, or API, the simulation reflects that change automatically with no update here — the plugin only needs attention when the narrow contract it hooks into (the model-runner / forward-pass interface) changes. BLIS and llm-d-inference-sim, being separate implementations, must be actively tracked against vLLM to stay representative.

vllm-model-sim's physics latency model is adapted from BLIS's roofline math, so predictions from the two tools are comparable when given the same hardware spec.

## Limitations

- Generated text is random; only timing and stack behavior are meaningful.
- Physics model `beta` parameters require manual tuning or auto-calibration via `eval.sh tune` (see [evaluation/README.md](evaluation/README.md)).
- Timing uses `time.sleep` (~1 ms granularity); best for ITL ≳ a few ms.
- Tensor parallelism runs as real worker processes, but the physics roofline models the per-GPU speedup as ideal (work divided by TP degree); it omits collective-communication overhead (~2 all-reduces per dense layer), which must be absorbed by `beta`.
- For prefill/decode disaggregation, NIXL KV transfer is simulated via a bandwidth model — no real RDMA transfers occur.

## Development

### Building the Dependencies Container Image

The Kubernetes deployments use a pre-built container image (`ghcr.io/llm-d-extensions/vllm-sim-deps`) that bundles the plugin and NIXL dependencies. This speeds up pod startup significantly.

**Build and push (maintainers only):**

```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub Container Registry
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin

# Build and push from repo root
./docker/vllm-sim-deps/build.sh v0.3.0
```

See [docker/vllm-sim-deps/README.md](docker/vllm-sim-deps/README.md) for version compatibility and update procedures.
